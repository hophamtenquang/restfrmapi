==========
Pygorithms
==========

A Python module to learn all the major algorithms on the go! <br />
Purely for educational purposes

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Super easy to use
* A very easy to understand `Documentation <http://pygorithm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* Get the code right in your editor
* Get time complexities on the go

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Just fire the following command in your terminal:

    ::

       $pip3 install pygorithm

- It's that easy. If you are using Python 2.7 use pip instead. Depending on your
  permissions, you might need to ``sudo`` before installing


Quick Start Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To sort your list

    .. code:: python

        from pygorithm.sorting import bubble_sort
        myList = [12, 4, 3, 5, 13, 1, 17, 19, 15]
        sortedList = bubble_sort.sort(myList)
        print(sortedList)


* To get the code for function used

    .. code:: python

        from pygorithm.sorting import bubble_sort
        code = bubble_sort.get_code()
        print(code)


* To get the time complexity of an algorithm

    .. code:: python

        from pygorithm.sorting import bubble_sort
        time_complexity = bubble_sort.time_complexities()
        print(time_complexity)
